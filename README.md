# Mini-F1-Telemetry-Dashboard
Interactive F1 telemetry dashboard using Python, Streamlit, Plotly, and FastF1. Built to practice OOP, data analysis, and data visualization.

Had a little too much fun combining my **recently learned data science skills** with my favorite hobby (watching F1).  
This project is a **Formula 1 Telemetry Dashboard** built with **Python** to practice **OOP concepts, data analysis, and visualization**.

---

## Features
- Load any F1 session (Qualifying, Race, Practice, Sprint)
- Select two drivers and compare their fastest laps
- Interactive visualizations:
  - **Speed vs Distance**
  - **Throttle & Brake inputs**
  - **Lap time delta over distance**
  - **Gear shifts**
- Displays fastest lap times and time delta between drivers
- Uses caching for faster reloads

---

## Tech Stack
- **Python**
- **OOP design**
- **Data analysis**: NumPy, Pandas  
- **Visualization**: Plotly  
- **GUI / Dashboard**: Streamlit  
- **Data source**: FastF1  

---

## Learning Goals
This project was mainly to practice what I learned in my **Data Science** course:
- Applying **object-oriented programming** in Python
- Working with **real-world telemetry data**
- Using **data visualization tools** to present insights interactively
- Building a simple but functional **GUI app**
